# about me
first-paragraph: Hi! Thanks a lot for stopping by! I am a Graduate Student at the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Nevada, Reno</a> (Jan 2024 - Present) and working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.dri.edu/directory/ananya-sen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Desert Research Institute</a> (Jan 2024 - Present). Current research focuses on mesoscale processes in complex topographical settings. With a particular emphasis on gravity wave activities during mid latitude storms and wave convection interaction. The fact that these small waves can powerfully shape large scale dynamics in a small time frame is both humbling and exciting.
second-paragraph: It all started, as I recall, with somewhere, between organizing ruled notebooks by cloudy, sunny, and windy days, I learned to appreciate simple systems with powerful implications; clear data, honest narratives, and complex processes beneath subtle signals. Clouds always felt the dreamiest of all, sometimes  scary, but always magical.
third-paragraph: These days, I split my time between research and study (with coffee as a constant companion) and night spent with unanswered questions, music, and the inevitability of sleep. That balance drives me, rooted in continuous learning, knowledge sharing, and the application of rigorous scientific research to support sustainability and informed decision-making.
